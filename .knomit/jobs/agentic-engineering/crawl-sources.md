# Recurring crawl sources

*** THIS SLOT IS THE SOURCE LIST AND NOTHING ELSE. ***
What belongs here: URLs to crawl, and URL catalogues that were expensive to discover.
What does NOT belong here, and where it went (split 2026-08-11):
  how to fetch a gated/blocked host  -> .knomit/jobs/agentic-engineering/fetch-routes.md
  standing rules for the job         -> spec.md on disk (Appendix S). Not writable from here, by design.
  per-run status, queues, rankings   -> crawl-state.md, whose revision history is the record.
Before this split, 93% of this file was not sources: 28 URL lines out of 436.
READ/UNREAD markers below are provenance hints only. The AUTHORITATIVE record of what has been
crawled is the ALREADY_CRAWLED union assembled by walking crawl-state's revisions.

'Caching challenges and strategies' and 'Static stability using Availability Zones' are NOT in the
catalogue and appear retired. Static stability is covered inside smaller-service-in-control;
caching's failure modes inside constant-work and lunch-rush.
