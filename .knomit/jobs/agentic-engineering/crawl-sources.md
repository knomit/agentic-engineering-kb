# Recurring crawl sources

*** THIS SLOT IS THE SOURCE LIST AND NOTHING ELSE. ***
What belongs here: URLs to crawl, and URL catalogues that were expensive to discover.
What does NOT belong here, and where it went (split 2026-08-11):
  how to fetch a gated/blocked host  -> .knomit/jobs/agentic-engineering/fetch-routes.md
  standing rules for the job         -> spec.md on disk (Appendix S). Not writable from here, by design.
  per-run status, queues, rankings   -> crawl-state.md, whose revision history is the record.
Before this split, 93% of this file was not sources: 28 URL lines out of 436.
READ/UNREAD markers below are provenance hints only. The AUTHORITATIVE record of what has been
crawled is the ALREADY_CRAWLED union assembled by walking crawl-state's revisions.

    a DIFFERENT source from openai.com/index and from the cookbook, it is plain-WebFetch-readable (no browser,
    no 403), and agent-builder-safety was found there unread. Scan it for new guides, not just the two known ones.

=== SOURCE INVENTORIES — catalogues that cost real fetches to enumerate ===

*** OWASP GenAI — RESOURCE SLUG + DOWNLOAD ID MAP ***
The PDF lives at https://genai.owasp.org/download/<id>/?tmstv=<epoch>, and the id is NOT guessable.
Get it by WebFetching the /resource/<slug>/ page and asking for the download URL, then curl it with -A
(see fetch-routes). The tmstv token does not expire — the same value has worked days later.
IDs captured so far:
  50592  State of Agentic AI Security and Governance 2.01   (139pp, read 12th run)
  56857  OWASP GenAI LLM Top 10 2026                        (122pp, read 13th run)
  49059  Securing Agentic Applications Guide 1.0            (July 2025, read 15th run) tmstv=1753666640
  46950  Multi-Agentic System Threat Modeling Guide v1.0    (April 2025, read 15th run) tmstv=1745459605
  52117  OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026         <- id surfaced by search 15th run, NOT YET FETCHED.
         Resource slug: /resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/ — note this is a DIFFERENT
         page from /resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/ and from the 2025/12/09 announcement post,
         both of which are already crawled. The resource page itself has never been fetched.
RESOURCE SLUGS RESOLVED BUT UNFETCHED (route 1b, one search each):
  /resource/securing-agentic-applications-guide-1-0/          READ 15th run
  /resource/multi-agentic-system-threat-modeling-guide-v1-0/  READ 15th run

*** COUNTER-POSITION TARGET, found 15th run ***
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09815 — "Extending the OWASP Multi-Agentic System Threat Modeling Guide:
  Insights from Multi-Agent Security Research". A published critique naming GAPS in the OWASP guide read
  this run: reasoning collapse across planner-executor chains, metric overfitting, unsafe delegation
  escalation, emergent covert coordination, heterogeneous multi-agent exploits, benign goal drift,
  cross-agent hallucination propagation, affective prompt framing, multi-agent backdoors. This is a
  Tier-1-shaped PAIR with the guide — fetch it before writing anything more from the OWASP MAS guide.

'Caching challenges and strategies' and 'Static stability using Availability Zones' are NOT in the

caching's failure modes inside constant-work and lunch-rush.

CORRECTED (fifth run): cognition slugs guessed from titles 404. Always pull
https://cognition.com/blog for exact slugs.
  'Coding Agents 101' = /blog/coding-agents-101-the-art-of-actually-getting-things-done
STRANDS DOC URLS — base is https://strandsagents.com/docs/... (NOT /latest/..., which 404s):
  .../user-guide/concepts/agents/conversation-management/  (READ; re-verified 15th run)
  .../api/python/strands.agent.conversation_manager.conversation_manager/   <- NEEDED. The 15th run found
     fact 714a540c attributing pin_first / proactive_compression parameters to the user-guide page, which
     does not document them. If those params are real they are here. Fetch before restoring them.
  .../api/python/strands.agent.agent/
Still unread: Swarm / Graph / Agent-as-Tool multi-agent patterns, session persistence.
NOTE (15th run): the Strands docs carry snake_case AND camelCase spellings side by side and document
some defaults for the TypeScript binding only. Do not record a default without recording its binding.
CLAUDE PLATFORM DOCS — the prompting page routes to PER-MODEL sub-pages (found 12th run):

All four UNREAD. The general claude-4-best-practices page now covers Fable 5, Mythos 5, Opus 5,
4.8, 4.7, 4.6, Sonnet 5, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5 and is ~58KB — grep the persisted file, don't re-read.
